Each room is a different scene, region trigger sends us to next scene.

Basic Gameplay (Iteration One)

Click to move (switching mouse function - move with keyboard too)
Click to interact (talk, look, etc - switching mouse function continued)
Walkable Areas (blocking areas, should be easy)
Walk behinds (layers, already built in, should be easy)
Hot spots (walk to area to move to next room, walk to area to trigger action, walk to area and be blocked)

Multiple Rooms (Iteration Two)

Replicate functionality across more than one room

GUI (Iteration Three - Seven)
 * particularly complex part that will probably rely on nGui heavily

Action Verbs (Iteration Three)

Dialog (Iteration Four)

Utility - sound adjustment, options dialog box (Iteration Five)

Inventory (Iteration Six)

Save, Load, Restore (Iteration Seven)
